# About learn-grpc

In this repository was built with the goal to learn about gRPC and communicate between various programming languages like Python, Java, Node and Rust.


# Requirements

### Python -> requirements.txt

### Java -> pom.xml

### Node -> package.json

### Rust -> Cargo.toml


# Folders

In each folder there is another README to explain how to run and test each client and server for each programming language.

- [Python client](https://github.com/epilif3sotnas/learn-grpc/tree/main/client-python)
- [Python server](https://github.com/epilif3sotnas/learn-grpc/tree/main/server-python)
- [Java client](https://github.com/epilif3sotnas/learn-grpc/tree/main/client-java)
- [Java server](https://github.com/epilif3sotnas/learn-grpc/tree/main/server-java)
- [Node client](https://github.com/epilif3sotnas/learn-grpc/tree/main/client-node)
- [Node server](https://github.com/epilif3sotnas/learn-grpc/tree/main/server-node)
- [Rust client](https://github.com/epilif3sotnas/learn-grpc/tree/main/client-rust)
- [Rust server](https://github.com/epilif3sotnas/learn-grpc/tree/main/server-rust)

**Note**: To run this correctly you need to run first the server and then the client.
